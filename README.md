# Workflow

These are the plugins I use with nVIM.  Will update this as I go.

The original purpose was to have an IDE, Markdown Notebook w/Image Rendering, and a terminal, all within my Terminal.

I use Kitty for the image rendering and will most likely add a few more guides/configs in here as I get more time and organize everything.

I hope this helps someone else as much as it has me~
